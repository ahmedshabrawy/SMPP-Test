This repository contains the Java source for a pair of test tools,
designed to allow the sending and receiving of PDUs. 

One tool is GUI based and allows the entry of PDU data via a series of
data entry screens. The other is a batch tool that reads a series of
instructions from an XML file.

These tools require OpenSMPP and JDOM.
